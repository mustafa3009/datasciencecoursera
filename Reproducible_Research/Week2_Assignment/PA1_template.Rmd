### General settings
```{r}
echo = TRUE  # Code visible
# options(scipen = 1)  # Disable scientific notations
```

### Loading pre-requisite libraries/packages
``` {r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```
### Loading the data
```{r}
#Set working directory
setwd("~/coursera/RR/week2")

#Load the CSV file
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "integer"))
```

### Cleaning the data
```{r}
activityData$date <- ymd(activityData$date)

#Check the data with str
str(activityData)
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate and report the total steps taken per day and plot a histogram
```{r}
#Calculate the steps taken daily
stepsDaily <- activityData %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print

#Plot a histogram
ggplot(stepsDaily, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Histogram of Total Daily Steps", x = "Date", y = "Total steps")
```
Mean total number of steps taken daily....
```{r}
totalSteps <- aggregate(stepsDaily$steps, list(Date = stepsDaily$date), FUN = "sum")$x
mean(totalSteps)
```
Median total of steps taken daily....
```{r}
median(totalSteps)
```

### What is the average daily activity pattern?
Calculate the average number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day and group by interval
```{r}
interval <- activityData %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(steps = mean(steps))
```
Use ggplot for making the time series of 5-minute intervals
```{r}
ggplot(interval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + geom_line(color = "lightblue")
```
Use which.max() to find out the maximum steps, on average, across all the days:
```{r}
interval[which.max(interval$steps),]
```

###Imputing missing values
The total number of rows with NAs:
```{r}
sum(is.na(activityData))
```
Fll in a missing NA with the average number of steps in the same 5-min interval. Create a new dataset as the original and use tapply for filling in the missing values with the average number of steps per 5-minute interval:
```{r}
 activityDataFull <- activityData
nas <- is.na(activityDataFull$steps)
avg_interval <- tapply(activityDataFull$steps, activityDataFull$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)
activityDataFull$steps[nas] <- avg_interval[as.character(activityDataFull$interval[nas])]
```
Ensure that there are no missing values...
```{r}
sum(is.na(activityDataFull$steps))
```
Calculate the number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using dplyr and group by interval. Use ggplot for making the histogram
```{r}
stepsFull <- activityDataFull %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print

ggplot(stepsFull, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of daily steps (incl missing values)", x = "Daily Steps", y = "Frequency")
```
Calculate the mean and median steps with the filled in values:
```{r}
meanFull <- mean(stepsFull$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
medianFull <- median(stepsFull$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
meanFull
medianFull
```

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

Use dplyr and mutate to create a new column, weektype, and apply whether the day is weekend or weekday...
```{r}
activityDataFull <- mutate(activityDataFull, weektype = ifelse(weekdays(activityDataFull$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(activityDataFull$date) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
activityDataFull$weektype <- as.factor(activityDataFull$weektype)
head(activityDataFull)
```
Calculate the average steps in the 5-minute interval and use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval for weekday and weekend, and compare the average steps:
```{r}
intervalFull <- activityDataFull %>%
  group_by(interval, weektype) %>%
  summarise(steps = mean(steps))

panelplot <- ggplot(intervalFull, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color = weektype)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~weektype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(panelplot)
```
From the plot it appears that the subjects are the most active in the earlier part of the weekday compared to the weekend.
